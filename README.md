# country-request-info
Woah! No way, someone's actually reading this! Thank you for taking the time to read this file, I appreciate it! 
Anywho, the follow contains breakdowns of the code, an update log, and some other information such as the API I used for this project. 

This project uses an API called "restcountries." Search for a country and it will display some information about the inputed country. 

Javascript breakdown: 
The class "View" contains methods responsible for loading content, loading spinners and loading errors, in the event a search error presents itself.  
The class "Data" contains methods responsible for obtaining the necessary country data which will then get displayed through the "loadCountry" method in the View class.  

Update log: 
v0 - 6/25/23: Release date
